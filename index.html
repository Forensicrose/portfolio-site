    <p>I am a forensic scientist and adjunct professer from Philadelphia, PA. I obtained my bachelor's of science degree in biology with a minor in chemistry from the University of Pittsburgh. I received my master's of science degree in forensic medicine from Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. As a forensic scientist, I analyze evidence that is recovered in reference to injury to person or damage to property. Some crimes include homicides, sexual assaults and property crimes. I possess 13 years of experience as a forensic scientist and 10 years as an adjunct professor where I teach inspiring forensic scientists about the field.
