I did the best on setting up my HTML. I used a tutorial to help with setting up the portfolio and I did not have any real issues with the HTML portion of it. 
I still need to practice writing functions. I used external resources to help. I keep forgetting one or two parts of the function and then it doesn't work. 
I relied on the lectures, external sources and my personal notes. 
My main issue is remembering how to properly write functions. I just have to keep practicing them. 
I used the lecture and the following external resources: https://youtu.be/-D6oTPA4vXc (Build a portfolio site from scratch); https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp (Javascript Functions).
