The component of the assignment I performed the best on was Git and Github. After the first lecture, I was extremely lost, but I met with the TCs and practiced in my free time. Both really helped me excel with this part of the project. 
Although git and Github did not pose much trouble, I did not realize that I had to create the "main" branch. I completed the assignment and when I went to create a pull request, both the "base" and "compare" were named the same, which was "answer." I reached out to my classmates in slack, rewatched the lecture and relied on other external sources and I figured out the issue. I also had an issue recreating a shape. I created it the first time I did my portfolio page, but the second time I was having trouble. I could not deduce why because I thought I set it up exactly the same as the first time. I then realized that I forgot to type "px" after "width" and "height." Discovering this took me some time, but I did not give up! 
I relied on the lectures, external sources and met with a TC. 
My main issue was trying to figure out how to recreate the circle.
